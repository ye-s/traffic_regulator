0. Application was built using `create-react-app`.

1. Asked functionality was achieved. 

2. No Class components were used in this assignment, only functional components.

3. I didn't used Redux or "emulation" of Redux with React hooks. No point of this in small application. But I have examples of using them in another repos.

4. I use React hooks for managin state and to "mimic" component lifecycle.

5. I used mobile first approach for this app, but I decided to pick
raw design and basic styling.

6. I used SASS for styles.

7. For vehivle image showing I used simple library `react-image`. It's lightweight library witout additional dependecies.

8. I added simple tests. Tests can be run by executing `npm run tests` command in terminal.

9. For tests I used Jest and Enzyme.
